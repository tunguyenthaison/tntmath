- A representation formula for viscosity solutions of nonlocal Hamilton--Jacobi equations and applications - [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00925)

    > This paper is concerned with geometric motion of a closed surface whose velocity depends on a nonlocal quantity of the enclosed region. Using the level set formulation, we study a class of nonlocal Hamilton--Jacobi equations and establish a control-based representation formula for solutions. We also apply the formula to discuss the fattening phenomenon and large-time asymptotics of the solutions.

### Direction
- Mean field limit
- Langevin dynamics
- Neural Tangent Kernel (fancy name, but basically linearization)

### Macchine learning starting point

- [Uniform-in-time propagation of chaos for the mean-field gradient Langevin dynamics](https://openreview.net/forum?id=_JScUk9TBUn), Taiji Suzuki, Atsushi Nitanda, Denny Wu.

Follow up: 

- [Convergence of mean-field Langevin dynamics: Time and space discretization, stochastic gradient, and variance reduction](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=9STYRIVx6u), Taiji Suzuki, Denny Wu, Atsushi Nitanda.
